# Spatial Analysis: Calculating Habitat and Deforested Proportions
# 
# This script performs spatial analysis to calculate the proportion of
# habitat and deforested areas within a 5 km grid over an area of interest (AOI).
# The final output includes raster layers representing these proportions.
# To conduct this analysis you neeed at least 3 shapefiles;
# 1. Area of Interest
# 2. Area considered as habitat (All forest type; Dryland, swamp and mangrove)
# 3. Area considered as deforested (Area that previously forest change and remain to non-forest for 5 years span)

# 
# 1. Setup and Libraries----
# 

# Install necessary packages if they are not already installed
required_packages <- c("sf", "terra", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
installed_packages <- rownames(installed.packages())
for (pkg in required_packages) {
  if (!pkg %in% installed_packages) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}

# Load Libraries
library(sf)        # For vector data operations
library(terra)     # For raster data operations
library(dplyr)     # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)   # For visualization

# 
# 2. Define File Paths----
# 

# Define file paths (modify these paths as per your directory structure)
# Ensure that the "output" directory exists or create it
output_dir <- "output"
if (!dir.exists(output_dir)) {
  dir.create(output_dir)
}

# Paths to input data
aoi_path <- "aoi_mid_sumatra.shp"          # Area of Interest Shapefile
habitat_path <- "habitat.shp"         # Habitat Shapefile
deforested_path <- "deforested.shp"   # Deforested Shapefile

# Paths to output data

# 
# 3. Create 5 km Grid----
# 

# Read Area of Interest (AOI) Vector Data
admin_boundaries <- st_read(aoi_path, quiet = FALSE)


# Check and Transform CRS to Projected (e.g., UTM Zone 33N)
# It's crucial to have a projected CRS (units in meters) for accurate distance calculations

  # Replace '32633' with the appropriate EPSG code for your AOI's location
  admin_boundaries <- st_transform(admin_boundaries, crs = 32633)

# 
# 4. Load and Prepare Spatial Data----
# 

# Read the 5 km Grid as a SpatVector for terra compatibility
grid_5km_vect <- vect(grid_output_path)

# Read Habitat and Deforested Polygons as SpatVectors
habitat_vect <- vect(habitat_path)

# 5. Spatial Intersection and Area Calculation----
# 

# Ensure Grid has a Unique Identifier

# 

# Perform Spatial Intersection between Grid and Habitat
habitat_intersection <- st_intersection(grid_5km_sf, habitat_sf)

# 6. Summarize Overlapping Areas per Grid Cell
#

# 6a. Summarize Habitat Areas----
#

# 

# Replace NA Values with 0 for Grid Cells with No Habitat or Deforested Areas
grid_5km_sf <- grid_5km_sf %>%

# 

# Define Grid Cell Area in Square Meters (5 km x 5 km)
grid_cell_area <- 5000 * 5000  # 25,000,000 mÂ²
